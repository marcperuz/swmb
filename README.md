# swmb

The swmb package is used to read and display results from single-phase thin-layer models, allowing for straight-forward and simple comparison
of different models results. It can also be used to prepare simualtion inputs and parameters. 

Simulation preparation and processing is currently implented for the Shaltop model, and partly for the r.avaflow model.
Tools for model comparisons are still under developpement.
